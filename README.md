# dreable bot
it's dreabling time

a cludged together inline telegram bot that uses AUTOMATIC1111's fork of the Stable Diffusion Web UI


How to use it:
  -Get your bot's api token and chuck it in a .env file
  -Set up a private channel and add your bot in it as an admin and get the chatID of that channel (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33858927/how-to-obtain-the-chat-id-of-a-private-telegram-channel)
  -Chuck that chatID in the .env file too
  -open up your command line and "python ./start.py" and it should handle the rest
